d-calc is a bolus calculator for type 1 diabetics using an insulin pen (not an insulin pump).

## Introduction

Once configured, start the app, input your blood glucose reading, input your estimated carbohydrate intake and it will suggest a bolus based on that information.

d-calc has been designed for convenience and helps to remove errors and guesswork when calculating your insulin dose.

## History

Started in 2012, d-calc is a bolus calculator for your iPhone. The project was originally in Delphi XE2 - the 1st Delphi version that came with an iOS compiler (and the FireMonkey framework). It ran on iOS4 and iOS5 and iOS6.

In 2014, the project was re-written in Delphi XE6. The new version added support for IOB (insulin on board), and an application badge (for units of insulin on board). It ran on iOS7 and iOS8.

d-calc integrates with Chris Bowley's [Diabetes Diary](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/diabetes-diary/id308154469?mt=8) (available separately on the App Store).

In 2015, Apple pulled d-calc from the App Store because it is out of compliance with guideline 22.9:

> 22.9 _Apps that calculate medicinal dosages must be submitted by the manufacturer of those medications or recognized institutions such as hospitals, insurance companies, and universities._

Are you a hospital, university, insurance company, or drug manufacturer? Please [contact me](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/svanas). Together, we might bring this project back to life. Diabetes is hard work. We can help patients with diabetes (often children) and remove errors from their guesswork.

## Requirements
1. Delphi 10 Seattle
2. Delphi Mobile Add-On Pack

## Disclaimer

Always consult your physician or diabetes clinic before use and please adjust the settings before using the calculator for the first time.
